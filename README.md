Welcome to the GitHub Explorer! This is a sleek and modern web application designed to quickly fetch and display public information about GitHub users and repositories. Simply paste a GitHub profile or repository URL, and get instant details like names, descriptions, stars, followers, and more.

What it Does?

User Information: Get detailed insights on GitHub users, including their name, username, bio, company, location, follower/following counts, public repositories, public gists, blog/website, and creation date.
Repository Information: Retrieve comprehensive data on GitHub repositories, such as their name, owner, description, stars, forks, primary language, creation date, last push date, and license.
